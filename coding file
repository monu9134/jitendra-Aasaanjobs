coding-file1) Help Sheeba out 10 marks
Sheeba was asked by a Recruiter to write down 100 numbers (1-100) randomly but making sure that no number is repeated twice. At the end, the Recruiter found out that Sheeba had done her work perfectly, but committed just one mistake of repeating a number twice. Recruiter asked Sheeba that she recruiter her only under one condition! If Sheeba is able to find out the only number which she is repeated in an optimised manner.

Can you write a pseudocode, which can help Sheeba to find out the number which got repeated twice?

                                                  solution
//using heapsort technique

int twiceNumber(int a[],int n) { Apply heapsort on array (this will reduce time complexity to O(nlogn) otherwise using brute-force technique complexity is o(n^2)) heapsort(a,i,n);

for(i=0;i<n-1;i++) { if(a[i]==a[i+1]) printf("number that is repeated = %d",a[i]); // print the number break; } heap sort void heapsort(int arr, int i, int size) { int tmp,j; tmp=arr[i]; j=i2; while(j<=size) { if((j<size)&&(arr[j]<arr[j+1])) j++; if(arr[j]<arr[j/2]) break; arr[j/2]=arr[j]; j=j*2; } arr[j/2]=tmp; }

                                    using brute-force tecnique
int twiceNumber(int a[], int n) { for(i=0;i<n-1;i++) { for(j=0;j<n-1;j++) { if(a[j]==a[i]) printf("number that is repeated = %d",a[i]); // print the number breaik; } } }

3) Closest to zero 20 Marks

This problem is also called minimum absolute sum pair. You are given an array of integers, containing both +ve and -ve numbers. You need to find the two elements such that their sum is closest to zero. eg. Array [15, 5, -20, 30, -45] Output should be 15, -20.
